Machine Gun Rehaul from vanilla.
Balance patch suggestion.

==What's in this?==
*Modifier damage for anti-tank vs wheel reduced to 100% (from 130%) 
**REASON: The box says "anti-tank", there is no reason to make wheels particularly weak to it. Giving that small buff to wheels will anyway not make it any more playable.
*Modifier damage Anti personnel vs tracks and htracks increased
**REASON: The htrack resistance to AP was insane. This gives a small buff to MG into midgame, which is the goal of the mod. While keeping htrack still a counter to MG.

=== Weapon modifier normalisation ==
I also normalize the weapon modifiers except on bunker buster. In other words, they all sum to 100% now. No more hidden 25% buff to tracks hp. To compensate, I gave that 25% HP to the propuslsion itself. So the efficient hp of the BODIES are exactly the same as they were before and they now match in the in game design screen with reality.

However, this also affected the hp efficiency of the WEAPONS mounted on tracks and htracks. Weapons with an high amount of HP are debuffed slightly when mounted on tracks. However, note that these will all benefit from stronger wheels from changes above as they add more HP to the cheaper bodies.

== TL;DR! ==
MG are better vs htrack and track
Wheel = better, but I don't think it's enough*.
Info on the design screen improved.

*We have an issue with the pricing of late game weapons. When the cost of the weapon is $400 there is absolutely no rationnal to save power on a $100 body instead of $150.
