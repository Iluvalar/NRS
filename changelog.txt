NRS504 is released! 
* Now containing 9 challenges that will both teach you how to play NRS in solo and provide an extra challenge for veteran player.
* Weapon upgrades now give 60% to all weapons + 20% for all weapon of the same weapn effect + 20% for all weapon of the same weight-class. Now if the opponent is an heavy class and don't feel your light weapon, you can switch for the medium class weapon with the same weapon effect. for exemple, going from AT-light (cannon) to AT-med (rockets). And you only lose 20% of your upgrade. Likewise, if you opponent was using cyborgs, you could use the same wreight class, and switch for AP-light (machineguns). Not only your machine gun will benefit from 80% of previous cannons upgrades, but your cannon already in game will still get 80% upgrade from your future machine gun upgrades. Making design much less constraining.
* All my maps also stored in the same folder. Some of the challenges require the extra map.

* Yes I know, these been a while between change logs. But so much changed in NRS+ that it's simpler to just assume everything is new.
* To that effect, put some efforts to improve the readme and give better indication to new players.
* Buffed all ranged weapon up to 20%
* Spread the weapons line into more lines. To ensure every region and weight class are represented.
* Lowered the overall power, so low oil feels like low oil again.
* Fixed the AI not being able to send units until 10 minutes. Be Ready! They are not holding back now!
* Moved legs later in the propulsion line. So people are less confused about where is the track research.
* Tripled the stock of "cash" ressource compared to the others. This will cause less fluctuation in the interest rate.
* Few bug fixes.

NRS+413
* The Equity tax calculation was wrong. Players spending in economic structures had an exponential growth.
* Adjusted power at start. It was too low and caused players to crash early game too often.
* It's hard to say with the equity tax change, but I think I added more power in general.
* The 40% of research in ALL weapon damage changed to a 40% ROF upgrade. This let weapon research be more competitive with bodies x propulsion upgrades. The 2 being multiplied together made HP grow over the course of a long game.
* Made the AI more agressive. More DMG upgrade and less economic buildings. It's a valid stategy to research HP and grow more resistant, but it makes annoying game on the receiving end. It's just more fun to have agressive AI than ever researching turtling ones that become indestructible.

NRS+415
* Nullbot now consider the state of the actual economy and attempt to pick the right building now.
* It also have complex economy personnality (ex. on could prefer residential and energy buildings while another would build parks and services)

NRS+416
* I found ~4 cases of weapon line hidding behind the last of another line instead of being a stand alone.
* Twin mg and twin AG now join the twin hmg in it american line.
* Increased Nullbot overall difficulty. I was crushing it on hard too easily. 

NRS+417
I tough it would be a good idea, since the bots use the economy like humans that they would impact the economy like humans. It was a mistake. there were games at 10% propaganda and others at 350%. A bit too extreme.
* Halved the impact of bots on the economy.
* Made economic personnalities more subtle
* Made the AI much harder. The hard was easy to beat, and medium was a walk in the park.

NRS+418
*Big oops! The price of bodies were 2x too expensive. I was not accounting the 100% propulsion participation. As a result, it was probably better to build a price class 4 weapon with a price class 3 body. My apologies.
*I realized that heavy(H) bodies, could be used to carry a weapon a price class above. Specially if you mix regions together. Some of those designs are not bad at all as well priced glass cannon. Therefor I'm introducing the light(L) bodies (nothing to do with factories of priceclass), they just have sad pitiful engines. But they can carry easily a weapon from a price class under. To create a somewhat tankier, but decently priced unit.
*In order to fill the now bigger variety of bodies, I had to resort in looping the body modification another time. Some bodies can have 2 mods. Get ready for the big_big_scorpion!
*I also want to apologies, because When I heavily modify the bodies like that, Your favorite body might disapear completely or be reclassified. This WILL happen again no doubt. So don't get too attached to those bodies, Follow the letters you are given to find a decent match.
*We are now using Warzone2100 4.6. And therfore you can find the particlegun, at the end of the flashlight laser line.
*The "category" the extra research information are not fully implemented yet. But you'll find the weapons having a line already. It will take some time...

NRS+419
*After an in-game test with a poor victim, I'm fixing the price of the unit 50% higher. My intuition is that by giving cheaper units, I made the game hyper stable. The constant production of units were making both side of the map able to just resist the existing skill and stategy advantages of the opposite team. Causing the game to last too long.
*Reduce by 20% the HP of economic building. Same reason; Even after breaking the stalemate and reaching the enemy side, I was unable to do enough damage to really make a dent in the economy. I mean, something need to break at some point.

NRS+420
*Something went horribly wrong in the previous version economy. After shuffling positions in the lobby a lot, and the construction of many banks in game, some players ended up with negative economy while others had explosive power. Something went wrong with the player positions.
**I capped the equity at 100% preventing preventing division by 0 in the code
**I spotted one instance of structure.player instead of "playnum" This could be the culprit, not 100% sure.
**I also cancelled the banks for now. While it's a funny feature, it have ruined many game because of code issue. I don't really think this feature is useful.

NRS+421
*I decided to play machine guns in a game, and it was very under perfoming. If a groupd of n units could all shoot at the same time, their power would grow in n^2 , if they all do the conga line and wait their turn to battle, they grown in n^1. I had this factor to 2 but it's unrealistic as the front line have the time to die, before the back line make it. I did several test against AI, and I'm confident the right factor is between 1.8 and 1.85. I'm trying 1.825 now and I think it's good enoug for a release.
**I'd love the opinion of anyone who try the price class 1 or 7 and wheter or not the under or over perform. We need to aknowledge that overkill is possible too. So very tiny units vs high damage output big units should be doing great. That's another level of design strategy to keep track of.

NRS+422
*The game was yapping about the lack of a single texture file. No gameplay changes.

NRS+426
*added reclamation2 bodies
*added crawlers cyborgs
*added a few weapons from reclamation
*Slight reduction in difficulty
*Optimal unit counts from 35->30 I felt there was too many units even in very low oil.
